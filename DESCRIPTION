Description: A C/C++ based package for advanced data transformation and 
    statistical computing in R that is extremely fast, class-agnostic,
    and programmer friendly through a flexible, parsimonious, and robust API.
    Core functionality includes a rich set of S3 generic grouped and weighted 
    statistical functions for vectors, matrices and data frames, providing
    efficient low-level vecorization and OpenMP multithreading (reducing the 
    need for iteration/vectorization in R). These are integrated with fast grouping 
    and ordering algorithms, and efficient data manipulation/transformation functions 
    (also callable from C). The package also provides a flexible and rigorous 
    approch to time series and panel data in R. It further includes fast functions 
    for common statistical procesures, detailed summary statistics, powerful tools 
    to work with nested data, functions that enable memory efficient R programming, 
    fast data object conversions, and helpers to effectively deal with variable 
    labels and other attributes. It is well integrated with basic R, 'dplyr'/'tibble', 
    'data.table', 'sf', 'plm' (panel-series and data frames), and accommodates many 
    other matrix or data frame based classes (like 'ts', 'xts'/'zoo', 'tsibble').
